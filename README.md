### [chord-sling](https://joon-ko.github.io/chord-sling/)

is a port of a creative assignment from a class i took called **interactive music systems** into the browser.

it works by dragging on the screen to slingshot musical shapes around. each shape has an associated wave type, e.g. sineor square, and a pitch. when a shape gets close to another shape, it plays its associated sound with volume proportional to the distance away from the other shape. (it's best to just play around and get a feel for things intuitively!)

there are various controls which are explained in chord-sling in a 'controls' tab on the top-right corner of the screen. one control of note is the redrag mechanism. you can reposition shapes that are already deployed by holding space, then clicking on the shape. this allows the user to have a slightly larger amount of musical agency. :)

there is also a graphical piano made with svg, which you can use to change the pitch of the music shapes.
